# StatusBolt
Python script that accesses aws s3!

- Enters a bucket;
- Takes all the names of the files inside the bucket;
- Assembles a list and compares it with the current date;
- If the current date is the same as the name of the file "horario" it shows online;
- Shows the filtered list with online and offline asset management in a pysimplegui graphical interface;
- Create an Excel file in the main folder.

OBS: This code will only work if you redo the modifications of the dataframe that is taken from the cloud. Don't forget to put your aws credentials
